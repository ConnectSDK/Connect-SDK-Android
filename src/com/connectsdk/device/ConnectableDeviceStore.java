/**
 * ConnectableDeviceStore is a interface which can be implemented to save key information about ConnectableDevices that have been connected to.  Any class which implements this interface can be used as DiscoveryManager's deviceStore.
 *
 * A default implementation, DefaultConnectableDeviceStore, will be used by DiscoveryManager if no other ConnectableDeviceStore is provided to DiscoveryManager when startDiscovery is called.
 *
 * ###Privacy Considerations
 * If you chose to implement ConnectableDeviceStore, it is important to keep your users' privacy in mind.
 * - There should be UI elements in your app to
 *   + completely disable ConnectableDeviceStore
 *   + purge all data from ConnectableDeviceStore (removeAll)
 * - Your ConnectableDeviceStore implementation should
 *   + avoid tracking too much data (indefinitely storing all discovered devices)
  *  + periodically remove ConnectableDevices from the ConnectableDeviceStore if they haven't been used/connected in X amount of time
