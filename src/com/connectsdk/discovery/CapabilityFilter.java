/**
 * CapabilityFilter is an object that wraps a List of required capabilities. This CapabilityFilter is used for determining which devices will appear in DiscoveryManager's compatibleDevices array. The contents of a CapabilityFilter's array must be any of the string constants defined in the Capability Class constants.
 *
 * ###CapabilityFilter values
 * Here are some examples of values for the Capability constants.
 *
 * - MediaPlayer.Display_Video = "MediaPlayer.Display.Video"
 * - MediaPlayer.Display_Image = "MediaPlayer.Display.Image"
 * - VolumeControl.Volume_Subscribe = "VolumeControl.Subscribe"
 * - MediaControl.Any = "MediaControl.Any"
 *
 * All Capability header files also define a constant array of all capabilities defined in that header (ex. kVolumeControlCapabilities).
 *
 * ###AND/OR Filtering
 * CapabilityFilter is an AND filter. A ConnectableDevice would need to satisfy all conditions of a CapabilityFilter to pass.
 *
 * The DiscoveryManager capabilityFilters is an OR filter. a ConnectableDevice only needs to satisfy one condition (CapabilityFilter) to pass.
 *
 * ###Examples
 * Filter for all devices that support video playback AND any media controls AND volume up/down.
 *
@code
	List<String> capabilities = new ArrayList<String>();
		capabilities.add(MediaPlayer.Display_Video);
		capabilities.add(MediaControl.Any);
		capabilities.add(VolumeControl.Volume_Up_Down);
		
	CapabilityFilter filter = 
			new CapabilityFilter(capabilities);

	DiscoveryManager.getInstance().setCapabilityFilters(filter);
@endcode
 *
 * Filter for all devices that support (video playback AND any media controls AND volume up/down) OR (image display).
 *
@code
	CapabilityFilter videoFilter = 
			new CapabilityFilter(
					MediaPlayer.Display_Video, 
					MediaControl.Any, 
					VolumeControl.Volume_Up_Down);

	CapabilityFilter imageFilter = 
			new CapabilityFilter(
					MediaPlayer.Display_Image);
		
	DiscoveryManager.getInstance().setCapabilityFilters(videoFilter, imageFilter);
@endcode
